# Problem Statement
“AtliQ Motors is an automotive giant in the USA that specializes in electric vehicles (EVs). In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in North America’s electric and hybrid vehicles segment. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%. Bruce Haryali, the chief of AtliQ Motors India, wanted to do a detailed market study of India’s existing EV/Hybrid market before proceeding further.”
